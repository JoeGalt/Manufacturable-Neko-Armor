This submod adds manufacturing options for several catgirl armors that are currently only purchaseable:
-Fuso Plate
-Combat Armor
-Space Suit
-Space Trooper/Guardian 

The purpose of this is to make the catgirl armors after tactical armor accessible at a more reasonable time than I feel they are currently. I expect Dioxine will make changes to the catgirl armors in the next update or two and this submod will become unnecessary. 

By Piratez standards for non-gals I have probably been a bit generous with the research requirements.

Note: reaching the tech requirements for these manufacturing options will not unlock the in-game pedia entries for these armors.
